# Spam vs Ham Email Classification

## Project Overview:
The Spam vs. Ham Classification project is a machine learning application designed to classify email messages as either "spam" (unwanted or fraudulent) or "ham" (legitimate). The goal of the project is to build a predictive model that accurately distinguishes between spam and ham emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised machine learning algorithms.

## Motivation:
With the increasing volume of emails sent daily, filtering out spam messages has become essential for maintaining security and improving productivity. This project aims to provide an efficient solution for email providers and businesses to filter out unsolicited spam messages while ensuring that important communications are not lost in the process.

## Approach:

#### Data Collection and Exploration:
The dataset consists of labeled email messages, with each message tagged as either spam or ham. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove unwanted characters, stopwords, and unnecessary punctuation.

#### Feature Engineering:
Textual data was transformed using techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer) and Word2Vec,AvgWord2vec to convert emails into numerical feature vectors that machine learning algorithms can process.

#### Model Selection:
Various machine learning models were tested, including Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. These models were selected for their effectiveness in text classification tasks.

#### Model Evaluation:
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their performance in distinguishing between spam and ham emails.

#### Tools and Technologies:
1. Python: The programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
2. Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to build and evaluate the classification models.
3. Natural Language Toolkit (nltk): Used for text preprocessing tasks like tokenization and stopword removal.
4. Pandas & NumPy: Libraries for handling data and numerical computations.
5. Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for visualizing the data and model performance.
